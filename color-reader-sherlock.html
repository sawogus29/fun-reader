<p><span class="subj">I</span> <span class="verb">had seen</span> <span class="obj">little of Holmes</span> lately. <span class="subj">My marriage</span> <span class="verb">had drifted us</span> <span class="obj">away from each other</span>. <span class="subj">My own complete happiness</span>, and the <span class="subj">home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment</span>, <span class="verb">were</span> <span class="obj">sufficient to absorb all my attention</span>, while <span class="subj">Holmes</span>, who <span class="verb">loathed</span> <span class="obj">every form of society</span> <span class="aux">with his whole Bohemian soul</span>, <span class="verb">remained</span> <span class="obj">in our lodgings in Baker Street</span>, <span class="aux">buried among his old books</span>, <span class="aux">and <span class="verb">alternating</span> <span class="aux">from week to week</span> between <span class="obj">cocaine and ambition</span></span>, <span class="obj">the drowsiness of the drug</span>, <span class="obj">and the fierce energy of his own keen nature</span>. <span class="subj"><span class="aux" data-pronoun="Sherlock Holmes">He</span></span> <span class="verb">was</span> <span class="obj">still<span class="aux">, as ever, </span>deeply attracted</span> <span class="aux">by the study of crime</span>, and <span class="verb">occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation</span> <span class="obj">in following out those clues</span>, and <span class="obj">clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police</span>. <span class="aux">From time to time</span> <span class="subj">I</span> <span class="verb">heard</span> <span class="obj">some vague account of his doings</span>: <span class="aux">of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder</span>, <span class="aux">of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee</span>, <span class="aux">and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland</span>. <span class="aux">Beyond these signs of his activity, however,</span> <span class="aux">which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press,</span> <span class="subj">I</span> <span class="verb">knew little of</span> <span class="obj">my former friend and companion<span class="obj">.</p>

<p><span class="aux">One night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—</span><span class="subj">I</span> <span class="verb">was returning</span> <span class="obj">from a journey to a patient</span> <span class="aux">(for I had now returned to civil practice)</span>, when <span class="subj">my way</span> <span class="verb">led me through Baker Street</span>. As <span class="subj">I</span> <span class="verb">passed</span> <span class="obj">the well-remembered door</span>, <span class="aux">which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing<span class="aux">, <span class="aux">and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet</span>, <span class="subj">I</span> <span class="verb">was seized with a keen desire</span> <span class="obj">to see Holmes again</span>, and <span class="obj">to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers</span>. <span class="subj">His rooms</span> <span class="verb">were brilliantly lit</span>, and, <span class="aux">even as <span class="subj">I</span> <span class="verb">looked up</span></span>, <span class="subj">I</span> <span class="verb">saw</span> <span class="obj">his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind</span>. <span class="subj">He</span> <span class="verb">was pacing</span> <span class="obj">the room</span> <span class="aux">swiftly</span>, <span class="aux">eagerly</span>, <span class="aux">with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him</span>. <span class="aux">To me</span>, <span class="aux">who knew his every mood and habit</span>, <span class="subj">his attitude and manner</span> <span class="verb">told</span> <span class="obj">their own story</span>. <span class="subj">He</span> <span class="verb">was at work again</span>. <span class="subj">He</span> <span class="verb">had risen out of</span> <span class="obj">his drug-created dreams</span> and <span class="verb">was hot upon the scent of some new problem</span>.<span class="subj">I</span> <span class="verb">rang</span> <span class="obj">the bell</span> and <span class="verb">was shown up</span> <span class="obj">to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own</span>.</p>

<p><span class="subj">His manner</span> <span class="verb">was</span> <span class="obj">not effusive</span>. <span class="subj">It</span> <span class="verb">seldom was<span class="obj">; but <span class="subj">he</span> <span class="verb">was glad</span>, <span class="aux">I think</span>, <span class="obj">to see me</span>. <span class="aux">With hardly a word spoken</span>, <span class="aux">but with a kindly eye</span>, <span class="subj">he</span> <span class="verb">waved me</span> <span class="obj">to an armchair</span>, <span class="verb">threw across</span> <span class="obj">his case of cigars</span>, and <span class="obj">indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner</span>. Then <span class="subj">he</span> <span class="verb">stood before</span> <span class="obj">the fire</span> and <span class="verb">looked me over in his singular introspective fashion</span>.</p>

<p>“Wedlock suits you,” <span class="subj">he</span> <span class="verb">remarked</span>. “<span class="subj">I</span> <span class="verb">think</span>, Watson, <span class="obj">that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you</span>.”</p>

<p>“Seven!” <span class="subj">I</span> <span class="verb">answered</span>.</p>

<p>“<span class="aux">Indeed</span>, <span class="subj">I<span class="verb"> <span class="verb">should have</span> <span class="obj">thought a little more</span>. <span class="aux">Just a trifle more</span>, <span class="subj">I</span> <span class="verb">fancy</span>, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. <span class="subj">You</span> <span class="verb">did not tell me</span> <span class="obj">that you intended to go into harness</span>.”</p>

<p>“Then, how do you know?”</p>

<p>“<span class="subj">I</span> <span class="verb">see</span> <span class="obj">it</span>, <span class="subj">I</span> <span class="verb">deduce</span> <span class="obj">it</span>. How do <span class="subj">I</span> <span class="verb">know</span> <span class="obj">that you have been getting yourself very wet lately</span>, <span class="obj">and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl</span>?”</p>

<p><span class="obj">“My dear Holmes,”</span> <span class="verb">said</span> <span class="subj">I</span>, “<span class="subj">this</span> <span class="verb">is</span> <span class="obj">too much</span>. <span class="subj">You</span> <span class="verb">would certainly have been burned</span>, <span class="aux">had you lived a few centuries ago</span>. <span class="subj">It</span> <span class="verb">is true</span> <span class="aux">that I had a country walk on Thursday</span> and <span class="aux">came home in a dreadful mess</span>, but as <span class="subj">I</span> <span class="verb">have changed</span> <span class="obj">my clothes</span> <span class="subj">I</span> <span class="verb">can’t imagine</span> <span class="obj">how you deduce it</span>. As to Mary Jane, <span class="subj">she</span> <span class="verb">is incorrigible</span>, and <span class="subj">my wife</span> <span class="verb">has given</span> <span class="obj">her notice</span>, <span class="aux">but there, again</span>, <span class="subj">I</span> <span class="verb">fail to see</span> <span class="obj">how you work it out</span>.”</p>

<p><span class="subj">He</span> <span class="verb">chuckled to himself</span> and <span class="verb">rubbed</span> <span class="obj">his long, nervous hands</span> together.</p>

<p>“<span class="subj">It</span> <span class="verb">is</span> <span class="obj">simplicity itself</span>,” <span class="verb">said</span> <span class="obj">he</span>; “<span class="subj">my eyes</span> <span class="verb">tell me</span> <span class="obj"><span class="aux">that on the inside of your left shoe</span>, <span class="aux">just where the firelight strikes it</span>, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts</span>. Obviously <span class="subj">they</span> <span class="verb">have been caused</span> <span class="aux">by someone <span class="subj">who</span> <span class="verb">has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole</span> <span class="aux">in order to remove crusted mud from it</span></span>. <span class="aux">Hence,</span> <span class="aux">you see</span>, <span class="aux">my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather</span>, and that <span class="subj">you</span> <span class="verb">had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey</span>. <span class="aux">As to your practice</span>, if a <span class="subj">gentleman</span> <span class="verb">walks</span> into <span class="aux">my rooms smelling of iodoform</span>, <span class="aux">with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger</span>, <span class="aux">and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat</span> to <span class="verb">show</span> <span class="obj">where he has secreted his stethoscope</span>, <span class="subj">I</span> <span class="verb">must be dull</span>, indeed, <span class="aux">if <span class="subj">I</span> <span class="verb">do not pronounce</span> him <span class="aux">to be an active member of the medical profession</span></span>.”</p>

<p><span class="subj">I</span> <span class="verb">could not help</span> <span class="obj">laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction</span>. “When I hear you give your reasons,” <span class="subj">I</span> <span class="verb">remarked</span>, “the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet <span class="subj">I</span> <span class="verb">believe</span> <span class="obj">that my eyes are as good as yours</span>.”</p>

<p><span class="obj">“Quite so,”</span> <span class="subj">he</span> <span class="verb">answered</span>, <span class="verb">lighting</span> <span class="obj">a cigarette</span>, and <span class="verb">throwing</span> <span class="obj">himself down</span> <span>into an armchair</span>. “<span class="subj">You</span> <span class="verb">see</span>, but <span class="subj">you</span> <span class="verb">do not observe</span>. <span class="subj">The distinction</span> <span class="verb">is</span> <span class="obj">clear</span>. <span class="aux">For example</span>, <span class="subj">you</span> <span class="verb">have frequently seen</span> <span class="obj">the steps which lead up from the hall to this room</span>.”</p>

<p>“Frequently.”</p>

<p>“How often?”</p>

<p>“Well, some hundreds of times.”</p>

<p>“Then how many are there?”</p>

<p>“How many? I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.” He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table. “It came by the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”</p>
